It's not like the sci-fi robots we see in movies; instead, it's a collection of technologies that allow computers to learn, reason, and act on specific tasks. For example, AI powers the algorithms that rank search results, tag friends in photos, and recommend movies to watch. It can also be used for more complex tasks like disease detection, fraud prevention, and environmental monitoring.\n","\n","One way AI works is through machine learning. This involves training computer programs with vast amounts of data to recognize patterns and solve problems. For example, an AI program could be trained on a dataset of cat images to learn how to identify cats in new photos. Similarly, a language generator could be trained on a library of text to complete sentences or answer questions.\n","\n","However, AI is not perfect. Its flaws can reflect the biases and limitations of the data it's trained on, as well as the choices made by the humans who develop it. For example, an AI program used to determine credit scores or predict crime could be biased against certain groups of people if the data it's trained on is not representative of the real world.\n","\n","To make AI more fair and equitable, we need to create training datasets that are diverse and unbiased, and we need to have a diverse workforce of AI developers and decision-makers. We also need to carefully consider which problems to use AI for, and make sure that these problems are aligned with our social, economic, and ethical priorities.\n","\n","Overall, AI is a powerful tool that can be used for good or bad. It's important for us to understand how AI works and how it can impact our lives, so that we can advocate for its responsible development and use.\n","\n","I hope this summary is helpful!\n","\n"]}],"source":["# ------------------ Watch YouTube Video ------------------ #\n","prompt = \"can you please watch this video and summarise in text https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbEbs6I3eLw\"\n","response = bard.get_answer(prompt)\n","print(response[\"content\"])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":28078,"status":"ok","timestamp":1705362863408,"user":{"displayName":"Muhammad Rafi","userId":"18163791769427540772"},"user_tz":0},"id":"e8LIcfeZikcX","outputId":"66f7ca87-6aec-49a8-b721-e070c559039a"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["<function ChatBard._get_api_key at 0x7d09a3e16cb0>\n","====================================\n","\u001b[44m          Welcome to Chatbot        \u001b[49m\n","====================================\n","If you enter quit, q, or stop, the chat will end.\n",">>> hello bard\n","\u001b[34m\u001b[1mChatbot: Hello!
